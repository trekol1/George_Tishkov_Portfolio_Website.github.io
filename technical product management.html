									<h1>Technical <br />product management <br />and data analysis</h1>
									<p>Analyzing large sets of temperature data <br />and implementing a complex multi-component geothermal monitoring system from scratch</p>
								</header>
								<!-- <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->
									<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="img/tech prod/yamal_peninsula.jpg" alt="" /></span>I was working on the polar edge of Russia, on the peninsula Yamal.<br />
									The soil there is mostly frozen and never defrosts, which adds complexity to any construction work in this area and requires permanent monitoring of soil temperature beneath any construction, in order to avoid sliding.<br />
									The company TaisS which I was working for was doing geological surveys of permafrost soils and geothermal monitoring. 
								</p>
								<h3>Initial challange</h3>
								<p>At the starting point, I was <b><i>analyzing large datasets</i></b> of soil temperature data and <b><i>bulding visualizations in Excel.</i></b><br />
									The data was represented by periodical measurements of soil temperature inside a particular borehole recorded at a specific depth. Over 7000 sensors were processed simultaneously.</p>
								<b>First visualizations and charts</b><br />
								<p>Below you can see a table (built using <b><i>conditional formatting</i></b>) with data for one particular borehole, which shows at what depth frozen soil is thawing (temperature goes above 0) in 3 years timeframe.<br />Columns are divided by date, and rows are divided by the depth and grouped by a borehole.</p>
								<p>Keep in mind this was just a starting point, things get better by the end of the story.</p>

								<iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-QLfnin0Kx37bVPAiiPSvRGKCNDYcbGsiZjlESgjFxSgWpoKODEcif8401LG0z1rymjtd6GCvyvMo/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe><p>The demonstrated data shows that permafrost is expanding in the considered borehole, i.e. frozen soil layer is getting closer to the surface every year. All temperatures above 0 are considered to require attention.</p>
								<p>The chart below gives perspective on a temperature range throughout a year and clearly shows the depth, below which temperature had never been positive during the survey.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="img/tech prod/soil_temp_data_demo2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Main product</h2>
								<b>Preconditions</b><br />
								<p>The data for datasets was collected manually by specific employees of the company, which <b><i>required significant human resources</i></b> to be involved and <b><i>resulted in substantial costs.</i></b><br />
								Moreover, collecting data manually caused a <b><i>delay in response</i></b> (from several hours to several days), which was critical especially during the season change.</p>
								<b>Product objective</b><br />
								<ul>
									<li>Measurements should be done automatically according to schedule.</li>
									<li>Responsible employees of the company should be able to get the measurement data immediately without the need to leave the office.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>So the company needed to implement a hardware system to <b><i>collect the data automatically</i></b> and post it to a remote database, in order to give service engineers <b><i>instant access to the data.</i></b><br />
								My challenge was to <b><i>manage the implementation</i></b> of this system <b><i>from the idea stage to the launch and commissioning.</i></b></p>
								<b>Work process</b><br />
								<p>By this moment, all financial calculations to estimate product profitability were already done by accountants of the company.<br />
								So I started with <b><i>collecting requirements</i></b> for the system from the CEO and internal engineers, and conducted <b><i>industry research</i></b> to determine a list of possible contractors to manufacture the system.<br />
								After I presented a list of possible contractors and the contractor was chosen, I was in charge of <b><i>forming system requirements</i></b> and <b><i>specifications</i></b> for the for the manufacturer.<br />
								The system got the alias ASGM (automated system for geotechnical monitoring) and after it was manufactured and shiped I <b><i>coordinated the installation and commissioning</i></b> process.</p>
								<b>Technical details</b><br />
								<p>The system consists of thermocouples (which are chains of temperature sensors connected by a cable) located in thermometric boreholes, and a controller that combines all sensors and provides registration, accumulation, and loading of data into a remote database.<br />	<br />
								The controller is equipped with:
											<ul>
												<li>GSM modem controller to transfer the data to the remote database</li>
												<li>a non-volatile memory, to store collected data in case of connection loss</li>
												<li>a redundant power supply, ensuring system operability in case of an outage</li>
											</ul>
											Special software on a remote server processes data received from the controller and, in the event of an emergency violation of the temperature regime or failure of system elements sends an urgent notification.</p>

								<h2>Expanding the product with additional feature</h2>
								<b>There still was room for improvement</b><br />
								<p>After the ASGM system was put into operation and the large costs required constantly for making the measurements were reduced, the collected data still required manual processing and visualization.<br />
									At this point <b><i>I puropsed the idea</i></b> of developing a web-based feature for real-time visualization of the collected data.<br /></p>
									<b>Work process</b><br />
									<p>I started with <b><i>calculating the current costs</i></b> and the resources involved in data processing, and <b><i>estimating costs for the feature development:</i></b><br />
										Data processing and visualization expenses mainly consisted of a data analyst salary of XXXX$/month or XXXXX$/year, multiplied by 1.4 to take into consideration insurance and taxes, which gave XXXXX$/year cost to the company.<br />
										To estimate the cost of development of such a feature I <b><i>briefly designed a prototype</i></b> in collaboration with the CEO and internal employees, who were expected to be the users of the feature.<br />
										Then I <b><i>contacted freelance contractors</i></b> from among my old colleagues, who I believed were capable of developing such a feature, and after presenting to them the prototype and <b><i>negotiating terms of a possible contract</i></b> the feature <b><i>development cost was estimated</i></b> at XXXX$. The break-even point was expected to come after 6 months maximum.<br />
										The next step was presenting possible benefits such a feature could bring to the CEO of the company, and after the project was approved, I <b><i>formed requirements</i></b> and <b><i>specifications</i></b>, and <b><i>coordinated feature development</i></b> and <b><i>integration</i></b>.
									</p>
									<b>Technical details</b><br />
									<p>The backend of the feature was implemented on <b><i>PHP</i></b> using <b><i>Laravel framework</i></b>. <b><i>Voyager</i></b> admin panel was used, and has been <b><i>customized</i></b> for project's specific needs.<br />
									Frontend was built using <b><i>HTML, Javascript</i></b> (mainly used <b><i>jQuery</i></b>). Visualizations were built using <b><i>D3.js library</i></b>, which is a pretty low level library. There are higher-level libraries, that solved problems similar to ours, but the project had a lot of specific requirements, and no one of discovered libraries fit them all.<br/>
									Intuitive and simple user interface is available remotely just like a website, allows to view data and graphs and also to customise visualisations and adapt them for downloading as JPG/PDF and printing.<br /><br />
									By the end the feature could build new type of visualization which is a slice of soil under the whole object, viewed from above and taken on a specific depth:
								</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="img/tech prod/soil_temp_data_demo3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>And this is how the first visualization from this story looks like built on a new web feature:</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="img/tech prod/soil_temp_data_demo4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h2>Results</h2>
									After the project was finished, company had <b><i>3 major outcomes</i></b><br />
											<ul>
												<li>Significant companies <b><i>resourses</i></b> required constantly for manual collecting data <b><i>were freed and could be directed to other activities.</i></b></li>
												<li>System development and implementation <b><i>costs were soon broke even</i></b> due to reduced fixed costs.</li>
												<li>Engineers got <b><i>access to temperature data in real-time mode</i></b>, which allowed them to <b><i>instantly respond</i></b> to any changes or emergencies.</li>
											</ul>
